To do on the orbit-fitting software:

hard-wired things that should be configurable:
*weighting factors on energy constraints
*integrator time step

Outlier rejection in fits

unsafe string operations

SVD decompositions of covariance matrices as better
test for degeneracies and more numerical stability.
