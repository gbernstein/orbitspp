To do on the orbit-fitting software:

* Multithread Merge
* faster compare() orbit pairs in Grow.
* Change all FITS array writes to fixed length
* Inertial Trajectory crashing
* Makefile should work without FITSIO info.

---old todo's:
hard-wired things that should be configurable:
*weighting factors on energy constraints
*integrator time step
* OpenMP guards in Ephemeris, Trajectory
Outlier rejection in fits
* Multithread Grow
* Fitter should be single-threaded, make new Fitters for different threads if re-fitting.
  (this was already the case??)
* Finish making Trajectory tables efficiently threaded
* Cachable planets in Ephemeris
* Get rid of WORST
