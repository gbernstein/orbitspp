To do on the orbit-fitting software:

* Spawn new Fitter that's updated with a new observation.
* start putting in OpenMP guards for multithreading: Ephemeris and Trajectory have internal states.
Fitter should be single-threaded too, make new Fitters for different threads if re-fitting.
* Fix sun motion for heliocentric Elements calculations.
* E covariances disagree with old code for qb1.
* Prediction code for list of times
* Get rid of need for YAML code to compile orbits (i.e. optional for Astrometry)
* Get rid of old astrometry/Ephemeris
* test programs for ephemeris

---old todo's:
hard-wired things that should be configurable:
*weighting factors on energy constraints
*integrator time step

Outlier rejection in fits
