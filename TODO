To do on the orbit-fitting software:

* Change all FITS array writes to fixed length
* Inertial Trajectory crashing
* start putting in OpenMP guards for multithreading: Ephemeris and Trajectory have internal states.
Fitter should be single-threaded too, make new Fitters for different threads if re-fitting.
* Makefile should work without FITSIO info.

---old todo's:
hard-wired things that should be configurable:
*weighting factors on energy constraints
*integrator time step

Outlier rejection in fits
