To do on the orbit-fitting software:

* Multithread Grow
* Multithread Merge
* faster compare() orbit pairs in Grow.
* Change all FITS array writes to fixed length
* Inertial Trajectory crashing
* Fitter should be single-threaded, make new Fitters for different threads if re-fitting.
* Makefile should work without FITSIO info.
* Can Trajectory LUT locking be avoided on read-only operations somehow?  Danger is that
  the LUT will be resized so vector references will change.

---old todo's:
hard-wired things that should be configurable:
*weighting factors on energy constraints
*integrator time step
* OpenMP guards in Ephemeris, Trajectory
Outlier rejection in fits
