To do on the orbit-fitting software:

* MergeOrbits:
  * Keep lowest FPR of two equal orbits
  * maintain/test number of unique nights
  * generate output information, save to files
  * cut inputs on nunique/fpr?
  * sum FPR tables, save output
  
* Inertial Trajectory crashing
* start putting in OpenMP guards for multithreading: Ephemeris and Trajectory have internal states.
Fitter should be single-threaded too, make new Fitters for different threads if re-fitting.
* Makefile should work without FITSIO info.

---old todo's:
hard-wired things that should be configurable:
*weighting factors on energy constraints
*integrator time step

Outlier rejection in fits
