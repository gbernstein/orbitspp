To do on the orbit-fitting software:

* Slight changes in getELements with and without epoch specified in Fitter
* testSharedLUT and testExposure* failures.
* Grow crashes - what is overflowing? Add start/end row counts
* faster compare() orbit pairs in Grow.
* Change all FITS array writes to fixed length
* Inertial Trajectory crashing (?)
* Makefile should work without FITSIO info.
* Thread the Bulk* programs
* Make versions of old executables


---old todo's:
hard-wired things that should be configurable:
*weighting factors on energy constraints
*integrator time step
* OpenMP guards in Ephemeris, Trajectory
Outlier rejection in fits
* Multithread Grow
* Fitter should be single-threaded, make new Fitters for different threads if re-fitting.
  (this was already the case??)
* Finish making Trajectory tables efficiently threaded
* Cachable planets in Ephemeris
* Get rid of WORST
* Multithread Merge
* Need copy assignment for trajectory
* Why does merge have WEIRD outputs?
