To do on the orbit-fitting software:

* Astrometry caches transform matrices for ecliptic, invariable
* Get rid of need for YAML code to compile orbits (i.e. optional for Astrometry)
* Get rid of old astrometry/Ephemeris
* test programs for ephemeris

---old todo's:
hard-wired things that should be configurable:
*weighting factors on energy constraints
*integrator time step

Outlier rejection in fits

unsafe string operations

SVD decompositions of covariance matrices as better
test for degeneracies and more numerical stability.
